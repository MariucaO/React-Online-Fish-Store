# React Online Fish Store

**Project**: [React Online Fish Store](https://github.com/MariucaO/React-Online-Fish-Store)  
**Creator**: Măriuca Onică  
**Technologies Used**: React, Firebase, React Router, Stylus, Prop Types

---

### **Description**

This is an online fish store application built with React, allowing customers to browse a selection of available fish products and add them to a shopping cart. The application was created as part of my learning experience through Wes Bos's *React for Beginners* course. Although still a work in progress, the project showcases fundamental React concepts such as component creation, state management, routing, and integration with Firebase for data management.

---

### **Features**

- **Fish Store Front-End**: Displays a list of available fish that customers can browse.
- **Add to Cart**: Customers can add fish items to the shopping cart.
- **Firebase Integration**: Data is fetched and stored in Firebase.
- **React Router**: Used for navigating between different views in the application.
- **Stylus CSS**: Used for styling the application.

---

### **Current Status**

- The app is still in development, with the cart functionality implemented but the checkout process and payment system still pending.
- The user interface (UI) and styling are simple, and there are plans to improve the design with additional features, like filtering and sorting of products.
- Firebase integration is set up for storing product data, but further Firebase features, such as authentication and order management, will be added in the future.
